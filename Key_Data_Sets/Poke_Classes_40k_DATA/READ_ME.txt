Here lies the 40k + Pokémon Image data set, that was scrapped with our web scrapper program. Which  we will try to clean together overtime.

I will post the Pokémon classes in an excel sheet and then we can mark the Pokémon files that are completed there, over time to ensure we did our best DD,  to clean this data set.
